# ParkinsonsRythymDevice

Here is the code of our final project for BME 66 (Engineering Design Process). We are designing a device that produces a rhythm at certain frequency for use in rehabilitation and occupational therapy in the treatment of motordegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's. Using an Arduino microcontroller we will emit a rhythm at a particular frequency with which the patient can "sync up" to move more fluidly and naturally.
